# Personal Dashboard

*Created by Ben Richwood, by a deep moment of loneliness (in a coffee in Hô Chi Minh City)*

Here is a [example of the result](http://lab.richebois.fr/dashboard).

## What is it for?

I'm fed up fancy/material/flat/user-friendly app. This dashboard is for true dev, ones who love dark background, font that permit to reconize between 0 or o; for guys who prefer to write incomprehensible phrases with flags and shortcuts rather than clicking on balanced button with smooth effects. 

`hull_of_the_spaceship` for style(sheet), and `Twin_Ionic_Engine` for the gear behind that.

langage / techno => HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Grunt (+NPM), JSON, PHP
Maybe also: LESS, CoffeeScript (?), Angular (?),

IE8+ works - not before
